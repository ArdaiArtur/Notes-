The switch statement can be used instead of if else statement when you want to test a variable against three or more conditions. 
Here, you will learn about the switch statement and how to use it efficiently in the C# program.

The switch statement starts with the switch keyword that contains a match expression or a variable in the bracket switch(match expression).
The result of this match expression or a variable will be tested against conditions specified as cases, inside the curly braces { }. 
A case must be specified with the unique constant value and ends with the colon :. Each case includes one or more statements to be executed.
The case will be executed if a constant value and the value of a match expression/variable are equal. The switch statement can also contain an optional default label.
The default label will be executed if no cases executed. The break, return, or goto keyword is used to exit the program control from a switch case.

int x = 10;

switch (x)
{ 
    case 5:
        Console.WriteLine("Value of x is 5");
        break;
    case 10:
        Console.WriteLine("Value of x is 10");
        break;
    case 15:
        Console.WriteLine("Value of x is 15");
        break;
    default:
        Console.WriteLine("Unknown value");
        break;
}


static void Main(string[] args)
{
    int x = 125;
    Console.Write( isOdd(x)? "Even value" : "Odd value");
}

static bool isOdd(int i, int j)
{
    switch (x % 2)
    { 
        case 0:
            return true;
        case 1:
            return false;
        default:
            return false;
    }
    
    return false;
}
