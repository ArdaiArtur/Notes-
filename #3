C# includes a decision-making operator ?: which is called the conditional operator or ternary operator. It is the short form of the if else conditions.

The ternary operator starts with a boolean condition.
If this condition evaluates to true then it will execute the first statement after ?, otherwise the second statement after : will be executed.
int x = 10, y = 100;

if (x > y)
    Console.WriteLine("x is greater than y");
else
    Console.WriteLine("x is less than y");
    

Nested ternary operators are possible by including a conditional expression as a second statement.
 
 
 int x = 10, y = 100;

string result = x > y ? "x is greater than y" : 
                    x < y ? "x is less than y" : 
                        x == y ? "x is equal to y" : "No result";

Console.WriteLine(result);
